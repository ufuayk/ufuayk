> I will be away for a while. I will isolate myself from my projects for a while to learn something. My main goal will be “learning”. Both programming and life and lessons. When I come back I'll probably have a ton of those damn certificates. Yeah it's a bit of a useless endeavor but I think I'll like it, learning something and being given something to do with it, I don't know about you but it's very appealing to me.
